# 1. Machine learning is programming computers to be able to learn from data to do tasks without being explicitly told
# how to do it

# 2. Image classification, film recommendation, anomaly detection, LLMs

# 3. A labelled training set is when each data point in the training set has a label which is the answer that the
# algorithm being trained should aim to predict

# 4. Classification and regression

# 5. Clustering, anomaly detection, novelty detection, visualisation

# 6. Reinforcement learning

# 7. Clustering

# 8. Supervised

# 9. A system which can learn from new data incrementally

# 10. Learning in which not all the data is held in memory at once.

# 11. Instance based learning

# 12. A model parameter is learned during training, a hyperparameter is set before training and controls how the
# algorithm learns

# 13. Model based algorithms search for parameters of a statistical model. The most common strategy they use is to maximise
# a utility function. They generate predictions using the model.

# 14. Overfitting, underfitting, not enough training data, biased data

# 15. Overfitting. Try using a simpler model, more training data, reducing the noise in the data by cleaning it up

# 16. A test set is a subset of the total data reserved for testing. This means the effectiveness of the model can be
# assessed on data that wasn't involved in the training

# 17. The validation set is used to select the best model and tune the hyperparameters

# 18. When training data is scarce, but something similar and abundant is available, the similar data can be used for
# training instead. In this case it is split into train and train-dev. Train-dev is used for validation.

# 19. The model can perform poorer than expected once deployed.
